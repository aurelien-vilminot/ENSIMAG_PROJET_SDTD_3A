The folder `image` is for the sole-purpose of pushing the images to an online repo.
The docker-compose file stays for the `docker-compose build` command that is helpful for building everything at once.
These files are meant to work with Kubernetes, not docker-compose, where hostnames don't work but only "localhost" do.
